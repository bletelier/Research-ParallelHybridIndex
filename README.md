# Hybrid Index with CPU-Parallel Locate queries to solve Pattern Matching

This is the CPU-Parallel version of the Hybrid Index by Ferrada et al. [1], this is the highest compressed index and is good to both repetitive and not repetitive texts. We achieved speedups between $\sim 1.3 \times$ and $\sim 4.7 \times$ better than the original Hybrid Index, for non-repetitive and repetitive texts respectively.
